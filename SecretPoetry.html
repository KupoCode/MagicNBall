    Dusting Off the Moon
  </p>
  <p>
    The moon is just silly, it really, truly is.<br>
Now hear me out, I’ve been as enchanted as you with her,<br>
I’ve heard the songs, I’ve seen the paintings.<br>
<br>
But what is it really? <br>
A worthless rock, in any other place, at any other time.<br>
It’s not a special hue; it’s a dull, lifeless orb circling us, <br>
like a cosmic clock just reminding us it’s bedtime.<br>
<br>
It’s not without its merits: the tides, it’s pull keeping us in check…<br>
But that’s not why we gaze, now is it? What keeps our eyes up high at night then?<br>
What makes it wondrous and terrifying all at once, <br>
when the starry sky lies besides her, also calling to us?<br>
<br>
The moon is no counterpart to the sun, yet we praise them both as equals.<br>
It provides no warmth, no light of its own, yet it is the poet’s darling.<br>
<br>
It’s glow a facade, only by chance do we love it and fear it and respect it.<br>
It’s for ‘those who are different’, yet it shows up daily.<br>
<br>
The Moon is undeserving, but maybe that’s just me… <br>
<br>
---<br>
But maybe, that’s just me.<br>
<br>
I am the moon, on your sights by cosmic luck.<br>
I am the product of happenstance, of chance, of probability.<br>
Glowing merely as a reflection of others.<br>
Useful because it’s what I happened to be.<br>
Always right at the place, right at the time.<br>
Not by choice, but because the heavens dictate it so.<br>
<br>
I am loved and cherished and adored, <br>
when there’s millions of other rocks out there<br>
With the same materials and the same structures just like me.<br>
But they quite can’t be, because they’re not in the exact ‘when’ like me.<br>
<br>
Look up at night and see all there is to it.<br>
Some undeserving dull rock, mundane and in the way of the stars,<br>
or tonight’s celestial main event always returning by popular demand.<br>
I am both at once and neither one, I guess I’m just as silly.<br>
I really, truly am.<br>

   -About the author's raw emotions-
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>The author of this poem seems to have a thing for you,<br>
    He's rooting for your triumph despite knowing you less than a percent of your liftime or his ,<br>
    He wants the best for you, with a reckless abandon of a kid who suddenly has a new fascination<br>
    It makes no sense to be perfectly blunt, yet here we are, me typing this in the past and you somehow reading it in the right now<br>
    The moon motif is appropiate, given the moonshot chance of us, far appart with no collision course to be expected<br>
    Will it be days? months? Is the wait souring this or seasosing it to perfection?<br>
    Who the fuck knows. Certainly not the author, probably not the reader...<br>
    As a wise girl once said: "fuck it, we ball."<br><br>

Happy Birthday <3
